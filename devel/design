Name of commands:
mrarchive: tool to create MondoRescue archives
mrrestore: tool to create MondoRescue restore
mrmini: tool to create MondoRescue mini distribution

mrmini design:

Goal is to create a bootable env contaning everything suited for DR/Cloning from the running system
It should

	- Initialize all what is needed (tmp dir, UI, syntax, ...)
	- get parameters from user bsed on conf file opions

	- get the boot loader info

	= Thee steps should be isolated in a lower stack (MondoRescue::Inventory) to be usable elsewhere
	- get all the FW info (when available)
	- get all the HW disk info (including Raid controllers)
	- get all the SW disk info (partitions)
	- get all logical layer info (LVM, EVMS, ...)
	- get all the FS layer info (deal with UUID/LABELS/...)
	
	- get kernel info (keep failsafe support)
	- deal with mandatory devices (kbd, USB CD, ...)
	- get all the mandatory tools needed + deps
	- create initrd/initramfs/... suited
	- get device driver support info (udev/devfs/...)
	- get the right list of dev. drivers

	- get target boot device details
	- generate target boot files/info (conf file format)
	- optional generate boot media
	
	- manages mondoarchive interface

	- Interface can be dialog based + a static text window which contains a log of actions done and running

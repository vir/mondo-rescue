Mindi uses the busybox (http://busybox.net) project to create the boot environement used during restore.

The best manner to use it is to also install our mindi-busybox package/tar file with your mindi installation.
If you rather want to install your distribution busybox, you'll have to check it supports all the required function our is providing, that it's place under /usr/lib/mindi/rootfs/bin/busybox and that ll required links are created.
